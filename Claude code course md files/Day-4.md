# DAY 4: Claude Code + Building Full Projects
## Time: ~1.5 hours

## PART 1: WHAT IS CLAUDE CODE? (10 min)

You've been using Claude in the browser. **Claude Code** is Claude living
in your TERMINAL. You're literally using it right now to read this course.

### Claude Code vs Other AI Tools:

| Tool | Best For |
|------|----------|
| GitHub Copilot | Quick code suggestions while typing |
| Claude Code | Multi-file editing, large projects, code review, complex tasks |
| ChatGPT | Quick questions, explanations |

### Why Claude Code is powerful:
- It can read your ENTIRE project at once (huge context window)
- It can create, edit, and delete files
- It can run terminal commands
- It can review your code for bugs and security issues
- It works from the terminal - feels like a senior developer sitting next to you

## PART 2: CLAUDE CODE BASICS (20 min)

You already have Claude Code running (you're reading this through it!).

### Key Commands to Know:

In your terminal, after starting Claude Code:

- Just type normally to ask questions or give instructions
- Claude will ask permission before editing files or running commands
- Type /help to see all commands

### Exercise 1: Ask Claude Code About Your Project

Type this to Claude Code:
"Look at my portfolio project from yesterday. Tell me:
1. What files exist?
2. What could be improved?
3. Are there any bugs?
4. Is the code well-organized?"

### Exercise 2: Let Claude Code Improve Your Portfolio

Type this:
"Improve my portfolio website:
1. Add smooth scroll animations when sections come into view
2. Add a loading screen animation
3. Make the design more professional
4. Make sure it works perfectly on mobile phones
Don't break anything that already works."

### Exercise 3: Code Review

This is something the SoftUni course teaches. Code review = checking code
for problems before it goes live.

Type this:
"Review all my JavaScript code for:
1. Bugs or errors
2. Security issues (like XSS attacks)
3. Performance problems
4. Code that could be written better
Explain each issue simply."

## PART 3: BUILD YOUR PORTFOLIO V2 (40 min)

Your portfolio from yesterday was v1. Now let's make it REAL - something
you can actually show to clients to get freelance work.

### What Makes a Portfolio Get You Hired:

1. **Clean design** - No clutter, easy to read
2. **Projects section** - Show what you've built (with screenshots/links)
3. **About section** - Who you are, what you do
4. **Skills** - What technologies you know
5. **Contact** - How to reach you
6. **Fast loading** - Nobody waits for slow sites
7. **Mobile-friendly** - Most people browse on phones

### The Big Build

Ask Claude Code to help you build this. Here's a detailed prompt:

```
I need a professional portfolio website. I'm a 16-year-old web developer
who specializes in AI-assisted development. Here's what I need:

DESIGN:
- Modern, minimal dark theme
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Fully responsive (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Professional enough to show potential clients

SECTIONS:
1. Hero/Landing - My name, title "Web Developer & AI Builder",
   a short tagline, and a call-to-action button
2. About Me - Short bio, my photo placeholder, what I do
3. Skills - Visual representation of my skills:
   HTML, CSS, JavaScript, AI Tools, Git/GitHub
4. Projects - Card grid showing my projects with:
   - Project image placeholder
   - Title and description
   - Link to GitHub repo
   - Technologies used as tags
5. Services - What I can build for clients:
   - Personal websites
   - Landing pages
   - Simple web applications
6. Contact - Contact form + my email + social links

TECH:
- HTML5, CSS3, vanilla JavaScript
- No frameworks (keep it simple)
- CSS custom properties for theming
- Intersection Observer for scroll animations

FILES:
- index.html (single page with all sections)
- css/style.css
- js/main.js
- js/animations.js
```

### After Claude Code Builds It:

1. Open in browser - does it look good?
2. Resize browser window - does it work on mobile?
3. Click all buttons - do they work?
4. Check console (F12) for errors

Fix any issues by describing them to Claude Code.

## PART 4: THE FREELANCING ANGLE (10 min read)

You said you want to make money fast. Here's the reality at 16:

### What you CAN do now:
1. **Build websites for local businesses** - Restaurants, barbers, small shops
   near you don't have good websites. You can build one in a day with AI.
   Charge 100-300 BGN per site.

2. **Fiverr/Upwork** - Create a profile showing your portfolio.
   Start with small gigs (50-100 BGN) to build reviews.

3. **Help classmates** - Build simple sites for school projects.

4. **Build tools people need** - This is Day 6's project.

### What makes money in 2026:
- People need landing pages (1-page websites for products)
- People need simple web apps
- People need their old websites redesigned
- AI can help you build all of these in hours, not weeks

### Your portfolio IS your proof. Make it great today.
