# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What This Is

This is a 7-day interactive course teaching AI-assisted development (vibe coding) to a 16-year-old student named Galin. It is a set of Markdown lesson files, not a software project.

## Student Context

- **Age:** 16
- **JavaScript level:** Basics up to switch/case
- **Tools:** VS Code, ChatGPT, Claude
- **Goals:** Build a portfolio website, build useful tools, start freelancing
- **Learning style:** Needs clear, simple explanations. Each day has LEARN, DO, QUIZ, and CHALLENGE sections.

## Course Structure

- `COURSE-START-HERE.md` — Overview, setup checklist, daily schedule
- `Day-1.md` through `Day-7.md` — Sequential daily lessons

**Day topics:** Git/GitHub + Prompts → GitHub Copilot + JS → Cursor AI → Claude Code + Portfolio → Debugging/Testing/Security → Build a Tool → Deploy + Review

## How to Assist

- When editing or adding course content, write at a beginner-friendly level (assume the reader is 16 with basic JS knowledge).
- Use the same format as existing days: numbered parts, code blocks, quizzes with answers, and a challenge at the end.
- Keep explanations practical and hands-on — always tie concepts to something the student builds.
- Course content covers: GitHub Copilot, Cursor AI, Claude Code, prompt engineering, debugging, security, testing, and deployment (GitHub Pages / Netlify).
